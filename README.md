# Flower-image-classifier
train a neural network to classify images of 102 different kinds of flowers

This project showcases the use of deep neural networks for classification of different flower species. it incorporates transfer learning and the use of GPUs to speed up the process of training a deep learning model. Argument parsing is utilized to make the project executable through the command line interface.

There are 2 parts for this project:

1. exploring the data and training a deep neural network to perform classification
2. use what we learned in part 1 and create a python module executable through the command line interface

each part of the project is put in a seperate directory.

* numpy
* json
* PIL
* matplotlib
